## 🛠️ State Management Architecture

The game uses a sophisticated state management system built on React Context and useReducer:

### Key Modules:
- **GameContext**: Provides game state and actions to all components
- **gameReducer**: Handles all state transitions and game logic
- **gameHooks**: Custom hooks for component integration
- **gameUtils**: Pure functions for game calculations
- **gameTypes**: Type definitions and constants
- **Audio State**: Manages synchronized audio playback across network players

### Custom Hooks:
- `useGameSelectors()`: Access game state with computed values
- `useGameActions()`: Access game actions with validation
- `useBoardLogic()`: Board-specific logic and helpers

## 🎯 Game Rules Implementation

### Board Layout
- **15x15 Grid**: Classic Ludo board with 4 colored home areas
- **Path System**: Each player has a 57-step path around the board
- **Home Areas**: 5x5 colored areas where pieces start
- **Safe Zones**: Protected positions (starting positions + 8th positions)
- **Center Area**: Multi-colored finish area

### Movement Rules
- **Starting**: Roll 6 to move pieces out of home
- **Regular Movement**: Move pieces forward by dice value
- **Capturing**: Land on opponent's piece to send it home
- **Safe Positions**: Pieces cannot be captured on starred positions
- **Home Stretch**: Final 6 positions leading to center
- **Winning**: Get all 4 pieces to position 57

### Turn Management
